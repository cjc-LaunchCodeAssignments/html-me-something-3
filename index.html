          <p>My hometown high school is located in a small town in Kansas. We didn't have a class for coding or learning about technology. We had a required computer class called Computer Tech, but it was all about typing and how to use Microsoft Word. We also had one elective, that I did take, that was about computer aided drafting. Again, the class didn't have much to do with coding.<br /><br /></p>

          <p>By my senior year, some people in my class were begining to use MySpace and a site called Xanga. MySpace offered ways to create a unique profile by putting certain codes into your background image. I'm not sure of the language I was using, but I believe this was my first introduction to coding. Then, I moved on to Xanga. It was more of a blog type website. I believe it was just revived a few years ago, but my site is no longer available because of inactivity. </p>

			  <p>I let the Xanga go. I didn't have time between homework and basketball. I continued playing around with MySpace as Facebook was really just catching on. I was a math major. I remember second and third year math majors talking about how horrible one of their classes were. It was coding. It always intrigued me, so I looked forward to taking it in the next couple of years. Then, the computer professor quit, and since we were a small college, they didn't need to hire another one for a couple of years. I didn't ever take that class because I ended up changing schools and majors. </p><!-- college mascot or M-->

			  <h3 id='firstJob'>First Job Out of College</h3>
			  <p>My first job out of college was not where I expected to be, but it paid the bills. I graduated with a degree in Crime and Delinquency Studies, but after graduation, I didn't want to do anything with that degree. I moved back home with my parent and started working at a lumber yard in my hometown. While working there, I started learning a little about printers, but not much else about technology. I did however have another employee bring in his computer multiple times to have me look at it and fix it for him. This include the small things like he accidently deleted his email bookmark or his laptop's mousepad wouldn't work. </p> <!--small town Kansas lumber yard-->

			  <h3 id='secondJob'>Second Job Out of College</h3>
        <div class='flex-box'>
          <div class='paragraphsSide'>
			      <p>My next job, which is where I am currently, began with me just being a backup to our technology person. My first codes into our network were to reset our printer queue. I loved it and wanted to know more. I didn't learn any more for a couple of months when our technology person decided to leave our credit union. My boss, the CEO, didn't quite know what to do or who to have move into that position. I threw around the idea of me doing it, and everyone said I needed to talk to him. I did, and he pretty much gave me the job right then. I have spent the last 4 years as the system administrator. My job duties are always changing due to changes in technology. One day, our website provider decided that they would no longer make any changes to our website for us, so after they showed me how to navigate the virtual server, I've been making the changes ever since. With us being a smaller credit union, I am the only IT person, so any new technology that is implemented, I have to be the one to show others how to use.</p>

        <p>This class is helping me to learn if I enjoy coding. I don't know what my future may hold or where I may go, but I may just follow coding and see where it leads me.</p>
